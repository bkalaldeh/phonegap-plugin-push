 *  @brief Add up to two delegates to observe UNUserNotificationCenter events. One for push notifications, and one for local notifications.
 *
 *  This property is added to enable support for this plugin to work in parallel with katzer/cordova-plugin-local-notifications. When receiving events related
 *  to a push notification, the UNUserNotificationCenter will call this plugin's UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate methods. When receiving events related
 *  to a local notification, the UNUserNotificationCenter will call katzer/cordova-plugin-local-notifications's UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate methods.
 *
 *  @warning This has only been tested with katzer/cordova-plugin-local-notifications@0.9.0-beta.2.
